# Serbian Chatbot

Serbian Chatbot is project of writing first multi-purpose chatbot for Serbian-speaking users.

# Rocket

**Rocket** is AIML generator written in Ruby for faster prototyping of AIML chatbots. Files generated by Rocket could be used independently of programming language in which chatbot is written, but Rocket requires Ruby to convert Ruby files to AIML ones.

## But tags are easier!

Tags are easier for beginners but for bigger projects it's pretty hard to write everything in tags. That's the reason why I made Rocket.

## Installation

If Ruby is already installed on your system, install ```pretty-xml``` gem, clone this repository and require core file.

```ruby
require_relative "lib/core.rb"
```

## Usage

To start writing in Rocket, define new specification:

```ruby
bot = Bot.new("botname")
```

You can define options for specification:

```ruby
bot.options({
	debug: false,	# define as true if you want to get logs from translation (helpful on bigger projects)
	pretty: true	# define as true if you want to get nicely formatted code
})
```

### Simple routes

```ruby
# Patterns are automatically uppercased
# when conversion begins
bot.on "How are you" => "I'm fine, thanks!"
```

```xml
<category>
	<pattern>HOW ARE YOU</pattern>
	<template>I'm fine, thanks!</template>
</category>
```

### Random responses

```ruby
bot.on "*" => rand([
	"I don't understand you!",
	"Write clearly!"
])
```

```xml
<category>
	<pattern>*</pattern>
	<template>
		<random>
			<li>I don't understand you!</li>
			<li>Write clearly!</li>
		</random>
	</template>
</category>
```

### Conditions

```ruby
# You can chain multiple conditions
# using + operator
on "My name is *" =>
set({"name" => "#{star}"}) +
cond({"name" => "Mia"}, "Hi darling!") +
cond({"name" => "Gordon"}, "Nice to meet you Gordon!"})
```

```xml
<category>
	<pattern>MY NAME IS *</pattern>
	<template>
		<set name="name"><star/></set>
		<condition name="name" value="Mia">
			Hi darling!
		</condition>
		<condition name="name" value="Gordon">
			Nice to meet you Gordon!
		</condition>
	</template>
</category>
```

### AIML content

All generated code is available via ```get_content``` method for each Bot instance:

```ruby
bot = Bot.new("chatbot")
# ... code ...

# Output: code converted to AIML
puts bot.get_content
```
