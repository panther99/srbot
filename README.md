# Serbian Chatbot

Serbian Chatbot is project of writing first multi-purpose chatbot for Serbian-speaking users.

# Rocket

**Rocket** is AIML generator written in Ruby for faster prototyping of AIML chatbots. Files generated by Rocket could be used independently of programming language in which chatbot is written, but Rocket requires Ruby to convert Ruby files to AIML ones.

## But tags are easier!

Tags are easier for beginners but for bigger projects it's pretty hard to write everything in tags. That's the reason why I made Rocket.

## Installation

If Ruby is installed on your system everything you have to do is to clone this repository or download *core.rb* and *topic.rb* files and put them in the same directory. After that, just import core to your Ruby script with:

```ruby
require_relative "dir/core.rb"
```

And you're ready to go!

## Usage

### Simple routes

```ruby
# Patterns are automatically uppercased
# when conversion begins
on "How are you" => "I'm fine, thanks!"
```

```xml
<category>
	<pattern>HOW ARE YOU</pattern>
	<template>I'm fine, thanks!</template>
</category>
```

### Random responses

```ruby
on "*" => random([
	"I don't understand you!",
	"Write clearly!"
])
```

```xml
<category>
	<pattern>*</pattern>
	<template>
		<random>
			<li>I don't understand you!</li>
			<li>Write clearly!</li>
		</random>
	</template>
</category>
```

### Topics

```ruby
music = Topic.new("music")
music.on "_ favorite band" => "Rolling Stones"
music.on "_ favorite genre" => "Rock"
music.end
```

```xml
<topic name="music">
	<category>
		<pattern>_ FAVORITE BAND</pattern>
